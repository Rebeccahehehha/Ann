# Inventory

Step-by-Step Summary:
Initialize Kaboom and Load Assets:

1. Import and initialize the Kaboom library.
   Load necessary sprites for the player and items.
   Create the Player Character:

Define the player object with properties like sprite, position, physics body, and scale.
Set up player movement using keyDown events for left, right, and space (jump).
Set Up the Inventory:

2. Initialize an empty inventory array and a boolean flag to track if the inventory is open.
   Create a function to add items to the inventory.
   Add Items to the Game World:

3. Place items in the game world with properties like sprite, position, and collision area.
   Detect collisions between the player and items, then add the items to the inventory and remove them from the game world.
   Display the Inventory:

4. Create a function to display inventory items on the screen.
   Use keyPress events to toggle the inventory display on and off, showing items as text on the screen.
   Start the Game:

# Implement player movement logic.#

Start the Kaboom game loop

1. Steps to Create Animated Cutscenes in Kaboom.js
   Initialize Kaboom and Load Assets:

2. Import and initialize Kaboom.
   Load sprite sheets for animations using loadSprite.
   Create Player Character and Main Game Scene:

3. Define the player character and add animations.
   Set up the main game scene where the player can interact and trigger cutscenes.
   Set Up Cutscene Scene:

4. Create a new scene for the cutscene.
   Add animated sprites and play their animations.
   Handle the end of the animation or use a timeout to transition back to the main game.
   Transition Between Scenes:

Use the go function to switch between the main game scene and the cutscene scene based on player actions or animation events.

## Plan ##

1. intro cutscene
2. Drawling cutscene 
3. Transition (No background but text)
4. Transition (/w background of game and showing controls )
5. Make Map (Just 1 Room)
6.
